## Algorithms

[Example: Long-Short Equity Algorithm](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/example-long-short-equity-algorithm)

> Quantopian flagship template that demonstrates how to use our Optimize API to
> trade a cross sectional equity factor. These types of strategies are typically
> quite robust and, if you've researched the factor model rigorously,
> statistically sound due to the number of bets they make.
